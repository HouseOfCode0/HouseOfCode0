        I was fascinated by how a few lines of algebraic expressions could be transformed into a precise problem-solving instruction set. 
        I still remember this movie as my first source of inspiration in the world of technology. 
        It was my initial introduction to the fast-paced world of startups, entrepreneurship, and technology.

        Driven by this curiosity, I was propelled into the world of software strategy, creation, and change.
