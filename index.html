      <p class="p-"><b>T</b>he still is from the movie "The Social Network," where Eduardo pens down the Elo algorithm used to rate chess players. 
        I was fascinated by how a few lines of algebraic expressions could be transformed into a precise problem-solving instruction set. 
        I still remember this movie as my first source of inspiration in the world of technology. 
        It was my initial introduction to the fast-paced world of startups, entrepreneurship, and technology. 
        It motivated me and made me think about the impact that a small group of individuals can have on the world by building something groundbreaking and revolutionizing the world around us. 
        Driven by this curiosity, I was propelled into the world of software strategy, creation, and change.
