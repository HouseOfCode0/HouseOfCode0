        I was fascinated by how a few lines of algebraic expressions could be transformed into a precise problem-solving instruction set. 
        I still remember this movie as my first source of inspiration in the world of technology. 
        It was my initial introduction to the fast-paced world of startups, entrepreneurship, and technology. 
        It motivated me and made me think about the impact that a small group of individuals can have on the world by building something groundbreaking and revolutionizing the world around us. 
        Driven by this curiosity, I was propelled into the world of software strategy, creation, and change.

                    <p class = "gene-p">In my opinion, most medical treatments improved the 
                        symptoms and not the root cause of the disease. 
                        Also, I believe modern medicine lacks a clear understanding of many physiological aspects of the human body. 
                        These unsolved mysteries of the human body intrigued me. Following my curiosity and passion, I took up the role of a Bioinformatician and machine learning engineer at Merck.
                        My research initiative focuses on decoding the complexities of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS, using advanced machine-learning techniques. By delving into gene regulatory networks, my aim is to uncover hidden patterns and essential regulatory hubs that play a pivotal role in the development of these debilitating conditions.

                    <h2>Tensorflow</h2>
                    <p style="width: auto;">This repository is a collection of projects focused on the ever-growing 
                        field of machine learning. It features a diverse range of projects, 
                        aimed at exploring different areas of this field, from object 
                        identification, transfer learning, natural language processing, and 
                        sentiment analysis, to name a few. These projects leverage a variety of
                         neural network models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 
                         recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) 
                         networks, and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks. By working on 
                         these different projects, you can expect to gain a comprehensive 
                         understanding of the inner workings of these networks and the 
                         principles behind them. One particularly exciting project in 
                         development is a cycleGAN that can generate different beards and 
                         hairstyles on user images. This project is a testament to the 
                         versatility of machine learning and the potential to create innovative
                          and creative solutions to everyday problems.</p>
